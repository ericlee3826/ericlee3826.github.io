                        Although there is often a misconception of how spacecraft get into <br></br>
                        space and go to different celestial bodies, the logic behind movement <br></br>
                        and energy are all referenced from Newton’s law of motion. The very <br></br>
                        first step is launching the spacecraft to space, and this is an example <br></br>
                        of Newton’s third law of motion. When it releases fuel and energy from <br></br>
                        its engine, the energy pushes back from the ground to propel the rocket <br></br>
                        upwards. Once the mass passes through the atmosphere, there are no external <br></br>
                        forces acting on the rocket, since space is merely a vacuum. There are <br></br>
                        no air resistance, gravity, or applied force in its current state, so <br></br>
                        it travels in constant speed since all of the forces are at equilibrium. <br></br>
                        It stays in the same speed and direction, or velocity. This is showcasing <br></br>
                        Newton’s first law, that an object in motion stays in motion unless acted <br></br>
                        upon by an unbalanced force. Then, when the spacecrafts leave Earth’s <br></br>
                        atmosphere, they are in Earth’s orbit around the Sun. Space programs plan <br></br>
                        beforehand the time their craft would leave Earth, as it is targeting a <br></br>
                        moving body. To do this, they take into consideration the speed and length <br></br>
                        of Earth as well as the targeted body’s orbit. This exemplifies the force <br></br>
                        of gravity and its impact in the velocity of spacecrafts, as orbits play a <br></br>
                        major role in the spacecrafts’ movement. <br></br><br></br>
                        Changing paths to different orbits require the same force that was needed <br></br>
                        for the launching of the spacecraft. To perform this, space programs fire <br></br>
                        their engine to the opposite direction of where their targeted path is, so <br></br>
                        that the energy released in the opposite direction creates enough result <br></br>
                        force. Finally, if the mission was set for a celestial body with an atmosphere, <br></br>
                        it would experience two forces. Atmospheric drag and gravity. As the spacecraft <br></br>
                        enters the atmosphere, aerodynamic heating occurs, which creates intense heat. <br></br>
                        By the force of gravity, the spacecraft experiences kinetic energy as it goes <br></br>
                        through the atmosphere. However, spacecraft designs have made them capable <br></br>
                        of entering atmospheres, through a blunt shape. The shape is used to gain <br></br>
                        more drag or friction with the atmosphere, in which creates less heat, since <br></br>
                        heat and drag are both inversely proportional. Then, the drag also contributes <br></br>
                        to decreased speed of the spacecraft, which allows rockets and parachute to <br></br>
                        function for the landing. <br></br> <br></br><br></br><img src="heatentry.jpg" height="200" width="300" border="10">

                        Physics is an area of study that is related to energy and matter,<br></br>
                        and it highlights the fundamentals of movement in space and on Earth.<br></br>
                         Energy and movement behaves differently in space compared to that <br></br>
                         of Earth, in which includes the pattern of how light, sound, and <br></br>
                         objects travel. Space program greatly rely on these concepts to <br></br>
                         launch spacecrafts to different celestial bodies in the Solar System.<br></br>
                        Of the well known laws of physics, Newton’s law of physics are <br></br>
                        implemented more often than others in space physics. <br></br><br></br>
                        <b>Newton’s First Law:</b> An object at rest stays at rest and an object<br></br>
                        in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same <br></br>
                        direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. <br></br><br></br>
                        <b>Newton’s Second Law:</b> The acceleration of an object as produced <br></br>
                        by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the<br></br>
                        net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely<br></br>
                        proportional to the mass of the object. <br></br><br></br>
                        <b>Newton’s Third Law:</b> For every action, there is an equal and <br></br>
                        opposite reaction. <br></br><br></br> <img src="CradleBall.png" width="150" height="100">
