                            <p style="font-size: 60%; line-height: 130%; color: white" align="justify">
                        Although there is often a misconception of how spacecraft get into 
                        space and go to different celestial bodies, the logic behind movement 
                        and energy are all referenced from Newton’s law of motion. The very 
                        first step is launching the spacecraft to space, and this is an example 
                        of Newton’s third law of motion. When it releases fuel and energy from 
                        its engine, the energy pushes back from the ground to propel the rocket 
                        upwards. Once the mass passes through the atmosphere, there are no external 
                        forces acting on the rocket, since space is merely a vacuum. There are 
                        no air resistance, gravity, or applied force in its current state, so 
                        it travels in constant speed since all of the forces are at equilibrium. 
                        It stays in the same speed and direction, or velocity. This is showcasing 
                        Newton’s first law, that an object in motion stays in motion unless acted 
                        upon by an unbalanced force. Then, when the spacecrafts leave Earth’s 
                        atmosphere, they are in Earth’s orbit around the Sun. Space programs plan 
                        beforehand the time their craft would leave Earth, as it is targeting a 
                        moving body. To do this, they take into consideration the speed and length 
                        of Earth as well as the targeted body’s orbit. This exemplifies the force 
                        of gravity and its impact in the velocity of spacecrafts, as orbits play a 
                        major role in the spacecrafts’ movement. <br></br>
                        Changing paths to different orbits require the same force that was needed 
                        for the launching of the spacecraft. To perform this, space programs fire 
                        their engine to the opposite direction of where their targeted path is, so 
                        that the energy released in the opposite direction creates enough result
                        force. Finally, if the mission was set for a celestial body with an atmosphere, 
                        it would experience two forces. Atmospheric drag and gravity. As the spacecraft 
                        enters the atmosphere, aerodynamic heating occurs, which creates intense heat. 
                        By the force of gravity, the spacecraft experiences kinetic energy as it goes 
                        through the atmosphere. However, spacecraft designs have made them capable 
                        of entering atmospheres, through a blunt shape. The shape is used to gain
                        more drag or friction with the atmosphere, in which creates less heat, since
                        heat and drag are both inversely proportional. Then, the drag also contributes 
                        to decreased speed of the spacecraft, which allows rockets and parachute to 
                        function for the landing.  <br></br><br></br>

                        Physics is an area of study that is related to energy and matter,
                        and it highlights the fundamentals of movement in space and on Earth.
                         Energy and movement behaves differently in space compared to that 
                         of Earth, in which includes the pattern of how light, sound, and 
                         objects travel. Space program greatly rely on these concepts to 
                         launch spacecrafts to different celestial bodies in the Solar System.
                        Of the well known laws of physics, Newton’s law of physics are 
                        implemented more often than others in space physics. 
                        <br></br><b>Newton’s First Law:</b> An object at rest stays at rest and an object 
                        in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same 
                        direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. 
                        <br></br><b>Newton’s Second Law:</b> The acceleration of an object as produced 
                        by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the
                        net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely
                        proportional to the mass of the object. 
                        <br></br><b>Newton’s Third Law:</b> For every action, there is an equal and 
                        opposite reaction. <br></br><br></br>

                            Hubble is a spacecraft still active today, and it is one of the most famous devices. Launched by NASA in April 24, 1990, it is the first major telescope to be placed outside of Earth’s atmosphere. It is constantly used to take pictures from far away galaxies, stars, and planets. The telescope is about 43 feet by 14, and its average speed is about 17,000 miles per hour. The hubble takes pictures by taking multiple of the same image with different color filters, and merging them to have a final image.

                            The Curiosity Rover is an instrumental device sent to Mars to find any possibilities that can support life. Having been active since August 5, 2012, it is equipped with 17 different cameras, each for different reasons, with a machine arm used to analyze data. It is capable of measuring quantity of radiation, x-ray, analysis, chemical components, etc.
